# PHAS3459-Scientific-Programming-Using-Object-Orientated-Languages
UCL Physics JAVA course used to teach data handling and analysis techniques using an object orientated language.

## Main Course Objectives:
### Basic program control & OO concepts/design. The student will become familiar with the following OO programming concepts, which are used widely in all OO languages:

- In-built data types & their manipulation
- Algorithm steering elements
- User defined data types: classes and objects
- Manipulation of objects using methods
- Constructors
- Polymorphism / Method overloading
- Inheritance, Abstract methods and Interfaces

### Implementing the most widely used Java programming tools. The student will become familiar, using the Java language, of the code and concepts, required to:
- Input and output data (to screen and files)
- Organise lists and other collections of objects using Java collections
- Handle program exceptions
- Create a multi-threaded application
- Create a simple graphical interface

### Program Design and Application. The student will become familiar with:
- How Java runs programs: JVM
- Java packages, jar files
- Constructing a multi-faceted program
- Applying programming concepts to physics analysis/modelling situations
